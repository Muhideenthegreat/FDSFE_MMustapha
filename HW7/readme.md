- It has a high data-to-ink ratio
- The grids have direct labeling and does not distort the data in any way.
- The axes are clearly labeled, and the data points are plotted correctly
- The plot avoids chart junk, such as unnecessary grid lines, borders, and symbols

## Bad Plot:

- The x-axis is not labeled. It is not clear what the x-axis represents.
- The data points are not evenly spaced(cluttered), this makes it difficult to compare the values of the data points.
- The axes are not scaled correctly.
- The plot exceeds the labelled y-axis, making interpretation difficult

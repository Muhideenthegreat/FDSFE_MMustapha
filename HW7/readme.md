- It has a high data-to-ink ratio
- The grids have direct labeling and does not distort the data in any way.
- The axes are clearly labeled, and the data points are plotted correctly
- The plot avoids chart junk, such as unnecessary grid lines, borders, and symbols

## Bad Plot:
<img width="768" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 3 36 53 PM" src="https://github.com/Muhideenthegreat/FDSFE_MMustapha/assets/73912076/277d9880-cab7-459f-b322-d81687c175c2">

- The x-axis is not labeled. It is not clear what the x-axis represents.
- The data points are not evenly spaced(cluttered), this makes it difficult to compare the values of the data points.
- The axes are not scaled correctly.
- The plot exceeds the labelled y-axis, making interpretation difficult

Caption : This overlaid histogram shows the similarity between the trend for male and feamle trip duration in this distribution. Both histograms are skewed to the right and we can see that most of the trips completed by both genders was between 100-600 minutes. The blue histogram shows the distribution for the makes while the orange shows that of the females. The male group also tend to have the highets number of trip as shown in the histogram.

Changes made:
  - Removed unnecessary grid lines.
  - Added a title: "Trip Duration Distribution by Gender".
  - Added a legend: "Male" and "Female".

Reason for the changes:
  - Removing the grid lines makes the plot cleaner and easier to read.
  - Adding a title makes the plot more informative and helps the reader to understand what the plot is showing.
  - Adding a legend makes it clear which group each distribution represents.

How the changes improve the plot:
  - The changes make the plot more visually appealing and easier to understand.
  - The changes make the plot more informative and helpful to the reader.
  - The changes make the plot more accurate and truthful.

Overall, the changes made to the plot make it a more effective data visualization.

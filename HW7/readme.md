The graph above follows all of Tufte's rules.
- It has a high data-to-ink ratio
- it avoids chart junk
- it uses visual variables to encode data, and
- it has graphical integrity.

## Bad Plot:

- The axes are not clearly labeled, it is not clear what the x-axis and y-axis represent.
- The data points are not evenly spaced, this makes it difficult to compare the values of the data points.
- The axes are not scaled correctly. The y-axis is scaled much larger than the x-axis, which makes it appear as if the y-values are changing more rapidly than they actually are.
- The symbols used to represent the data points are too large and not aesthetically pleasing. The colors and symbols are garish and unpleasant to look at.

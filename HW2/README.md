### HomeWork 2

- What is this homework about?<br>
The homework is about the descriptive and exploratory analysis of Youtube dataset. The goal was to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and patterns, using statistical measures and visualization techniques to understand the distribution, relationships, and trends within the data

- Who did you work with? <br>
I worked with Ademidun Adesola. 

- Did you lead any of the work in your group? what where your specific contributions (if you were not ready to lead any aspect that is perfectly ok, just state so! but you and your group mates should have consistent statements) <br>
Most of my work was completed by me and when I was confused about some questions, I reached out to Dr.Bianco via Slack. The collaboration with Ademidun was to help each other in better understanding the new concepts in the homework.

## Homework 4

- what the homework was about<br>
  The homework was about coming up with hypothesis for differnt scenarios in a population dataset, and using various test methods to check if our hpothesis is right or wrong. 

- what you learned (one or two may take home points for you from doing the exercise. Can be the analytical aspects or some practical method to do things) <br>
  - I learned how to come up with a NULL and Alternate hypothesis
  - I learned how to use different tests to check accuracy of conclusions
  - I learned how to normalize different samples

- who you worked with<br>
  I worked with Ademidun Adesola

- what you contributed specifically into the group work (if this assignment was hard for you and you do not feel like you were leading any aspects of it that is ok! I am asking you to state this to ensure you do some introspection and check your progress throughout the course)
  - I did most of the work by myself, and me and Mimi met to further expand and discuss our approaches to coming up with hypothesis for different scenarios.

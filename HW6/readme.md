## Homework 6

- what the homework was about<br>
  The homework was about Supervised Learning methods 

- what you learned (one or two may take home points for you from doing the exercise. Can be the analytical aspects or some practical method to do things) <br>
  - I learned how to access dataset from kaggle
  - I learned how to derive probabilities of certain events from given dataset
  - I learned how to split and extract relevent part of data needed for analysis
  - I learned tree-based and other supervised learning methods 

- who you worked with<br>
  I worked with Ademidun Adesola

- what you contributed specifically into the group work (if this assignment was hard for you and you do not feel like you were leading any aspects of it that is ok! I am asking you to state this to ensure you do some introspection and check your progress throughout the course)
  - I setup my kaggle account by myself, did most of the work by myself, and me and Mimi met to further expand and discuss how to interpret the scores from various supervised learning methods so as to decide what methods might be the most efficient .
